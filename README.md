# HMM-Viterbi
POS Tagging simulator using HMM method with Viterbi algorithm
Hidden Markov Model is one of the method to find the best sequence from a hidden path. This method could be use as a POS Tagger. Combined with Viterbi algorithm to reduce time complexity. Use Laplacian Smoothing to rise the accuracy.

### How to run
To run the program on your terminal:
javac HMMViterbi.java
java HMMViterbi

### The data
The training data should be put on a folder named Training. It could be more than one file.
The testing data should be put on a folder named Testing2. It could be more than one file.
The testing data should include the real tag for computing the accuracy.
The output will be put on a folder named Output
